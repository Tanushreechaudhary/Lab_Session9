# A cognitive walkthrough for the recruiters!

This is a redesign version of lab session 6, where we developed an interactive visualization to provide recruiters an essence of MSIS program at Santa Clara University. Here is the link: <br />

## Lab 6 Visualization:


## Critique for the Visualization:
The Visualization covers three metrics the four-year graduation rate, SCU graduates average salary, and percentage of students with GPA 3.75 or higher. In this lab session, we were supposed to develop an interactive visualization to help recruiters know why should they hire SCU students. But the visualization above is neither interactive nor it provides any valuable information that would be helpful from a recruiter's standpoint. Also, it only compares data about three universities and leaves out the other significant competitors.

## Roadmap for Improvement:
In the redesign version, I will be developing interactive visualization using three datasets - the MSIS skillset, MSIS students mid career salary and the university rankings in CA. The skills acquired by the MSIS students and the number of people having them will help recruiters to know that students at SCU have a erfect blend of techical and business skills required to excel in the market. Mid career salary would tell them how quickly the students graduated from SCU MSIS progress in thrie career. And lastly, university rankings data helps them to analyze the quality of education students had. These three important metrics would answer the audience's questions as to Why they should hire SCU graduates?

## Audience:
The audience here are the "Recruiters" looking to hire potential candidates. The first thing a recruiter would do is to map his requirements as per the skill set of the candidate. So, MSIS skill set is an important metric that would show what are the technical and business skills possessed by MSIS students at SCU. Secondly, how good SCU graduates are performing in their careers by seeing the mid-career salaries. And thirdly, the ranking of the university the student belongs to helps them evaluate the reputation of the university a candidate has studied in.

### Audience Need:
The need is to hire a highly skilled person from both technical and business aspects that can match their job requirements
