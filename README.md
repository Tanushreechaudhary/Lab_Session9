# A cognitive walkthrough for the recruiters!

This is a redesign version of lab session 6, where we developed an interactive visualization to provide recruiters an essence of MSIS program at Santa Clara University. Here is the link: <br />

## Lab 6 Visualization:


## Critique for the Visualization:
The Visualization covers three metrics the four-year graduation rate, SCU graduates average salary, and percentage of students with GPA 3.75 or higher. In this lab session, we were supposed to develop an interactive visualization to help recruiters know why should they hire SCU students. But the visualization above is neither interactive nor it provides any valuable information that would be helpful from a recruiter's standpoint. Also, it only compares data about three universities and leaves out the other significant competitors.

## Roadmap for Improvement:
In the redesign version, I will be adding data about 3 different metrics - the MSIS skillset, MSIS students mid career salary and the university rankings in CA.
